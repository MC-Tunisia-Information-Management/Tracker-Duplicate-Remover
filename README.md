# Tracker-Duplicate-Remover
The `removeDuplicateRowsGT()` function is designed to remove duplicate rows based on a unique identifier (ID) in column A of the "OGTa/e" sheet within a Google Sheets document. It begins by fetching all data in column A starting from row 5. An object (`idTracker`) is utilized to keep track of encountered IDs and their corresponding row indices. Duplicate rows are identified by checking if an ID has already been tracked; if so, the row index of the duplicate is added to an array (`rowsToDelete`) for deletion. After identifying all duplicates, the function sorts `rowsToDelete` in descending order to ensure deletion starts from the bottom of the sheet, avoiding index shifting issues. Finally, it iterates through `rowsToDelete` and deletes the respective rows from the sheet, effectively eliminating duplicate entries based on the ID criterion. This script is particularly useful for maintaining data integrity and cleanliness within the specified sheet, ensuring each ID remains unique and eliminating redundant entries.
